\title{Medical Concept Sets Definition and Expansion}
\description{
This script defines and expands various concept sets related to medical data. It utilizes the Capr library to fetch all descendant concepts
for each defined concept set, ensuring comprehensive coverage of related medical concepts.
}
\details{
The script initializes by defining multiple concept sets within a list structure. Each concept set contains unique identifiers for medical concepts,
which are expanded to include all descendant concepts using the Capr library's functionality. The expanded concept sets are then stored in a new list within
the `conceptSets` object. Finally, the script outputs a confirmation message indicating successful sourcing and expansion of concept sets.
}
\note{
This script requires the Capr library to be installed and loaded for proper execution.
