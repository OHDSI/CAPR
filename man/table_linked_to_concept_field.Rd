\title{Link Table Names to Respective Concept ID Fields}
\format{
An object of class \code{list} of length 9.
}
\usage{
links
}
\description{
This script creates a list mapping various table names to their respective
concept ID fields. This mapping is useful for dynamically referencing
concept IDs across different tables in a database schema, particularly
within the context of healthcare data where tables represent different
aspects of patient information (e.g., conditions, drug exposures).
}
\details{
The `links` list object contains key-value pairs where each key is
a table name and the corresponding value is the name of the field that
contains the concept ID within that table. This object can be used to
programmatically access concept ID fields by table name.

The following tables and their concept ID fields are included:
- `condition_occurrence`: `condition_concept_id`
- `death`: `cause_concept_id`
- `device_exposure`: `device_concept_id`
- `drug_exposure`: `drug_concept_id`
- `measurement`: `measurement_concept_id`
- `observation`: `observation_concept_id`
- `procedure_occurrence`: `procedure_concept_id`
- `specimen`: `specimen_concept_id`
- `visit_occurrence`: `visit_concept_id`
}
\examples{
# Access the concept ID field for the condition_occurrence table
concept_field <- links$condition_occurrence
print(concept_field)
