# Capr

Cohort definition Application Programming in R

# Introduction

Capr is an R package to develop and manipulate OHDSI cohort definitions. This package assists in creating a cohort definition that can be compiled by circe-be using CirceR. Cohort definitions developed in Capr are compatible with OHDSI ATLAS. Additionally the package allows for development of cohort design components, sub-items of a cohort design that are meant to be reusable and mutable to assist creating cohorts in study development. 

Note this package is an early release and is still under development. Capr was developed by LTS Computing LLC and has been released as open source for the OHDSI community.
