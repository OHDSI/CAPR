#' Count Occurrences of Values in Database Tables
#'
#' This function counts the occurrences of specified concept ids within specified tables in a OMOP database, 
#' including direct occurrences and occurrences through descendants, based on a provided cdm_schema and links.
#' It returns a tibble summarizing the counts across persons and across records.
#'
#' @param v A vector of concept_ids to count occurrences for.
#' @param tables A character vector of CDM table names to search within.
#' @param links A list linking each table to its respective concept_id field.
#' @param db_connection A database connection object through which queries will be executed.
#' @param cdm_schema The database cdm_schema in which the tables are located.
#' @param vocab_schema The database vocab_schema in which the concept tables are located.
#' @param save_path The path to save the results to. If NULL, the results are not saved.
#'
#' @return A tibble with columns for the number of times any concept from 'v' occurs: direct count of persons, 
#'         direct count of records, descendant count of persons, and descendant count of records. 
#'         The tibble also includes the concept names derived from `v` and is arranged by the total 
#'         record count (direct + descendant).
#'
#' @examples
#' # Assuming `db_connection` is a valid database connection, `cdm_schema` is set to "public",
#' # `tables` contains the names of the tables to search, `links` defines the relevant fields,
#' # and `v` contains the values to search for:
#' results <- countOccurrences(v = c(1, 2), tables = c("observation", "condition_occurrence"), 
#'                             links = list(observation = "observation_concept_id", condition_occurrence = "condition_concept_id", ...), 
#'                             db_connection = db_connection, cdm_schema = "public")
